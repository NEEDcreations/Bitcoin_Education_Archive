A mental model is needed of how physical power projection works, why it works, and what its primary value-delivered function is for the organisms which master it.\"\n\n3.2 Physical Power & Resource Ownership\n\n3.2.1 Proof-of Power is Proof-of-Ownership\n\n\"Since the dawn of life on Earth, organisms have evolved increasingly more creative ways to project physical power to settle disputes, secure control authority over resources, achieve consensus on the state of ownership ad chain of custody of property, and establish dominance hierarchies (a.k.a. pecking order). The control authority over Earth's natural resources that many plants and animals enjoy todday appears to be the byproduct of energy exerted over time (joules/sec). This would imply that property ownership has a physical signature that can be denominated in watts.\"\n\n\"Watts signal ownership. Organisms determine what they own based not on what they say, but on what they do - how they project their watts.\"\n\n\"When an organism stops using watts to secure their access to a resource, their perceived ownership of that resource disappears.\""}, {"text": "\"The property rights we enjoy today exist because people were willing to project lots of physical power to claim and maintain those rights. Without the expenditure of watts by living things to secure access to precious resources, living creatures are unable to perceive a resource as being something's property in the first place. Without physical power, resources are either perceived to be unclaimed (therefore not property), or resource ownership is purely an abstract construct that manifests as a belief system - belief systems which can be ignored, exploited or considered illegitimate.\""}, {"text": "3.2.2 Signaling Ownership by Showing One's Capacity and Inclination to Impose Severe Physical Costs", "imgs": ["images/helpdesk/softwar_051_image0.jpg"]}, {"text": "A Wolf's capacity and willingness to impose severe physical costs to secure her access to freshly hunted meat is displayed via her snarl, and it would likely leave a clear impression on the reader. There are two things to be noted about this display. The first is that her power projection capacity is physically quantifiable. With the right sensors, we could measure her capacity to project power in watts. The second thing about this display is the fact that those watts are the only independently verifiable and objective signal of ownership based in physical reality. Her ownership of the meat manifests itself through the power she projects to secure her access to the meat. That snarl serves as her certificate of ownership. In other words, her proof-of-power is her proof-of-ownership.\n\n\"Without her physical projection of power, there is no physical signature from which we can perceive or denominate her ownership of the meat.\"\n\n\"Since physical power is the only part of the phenomenon of property ownership that appears to be based in shared objective physical reality, physical power competitions are the only non-imaginary way for organisms with no belief systems or conflicting belief systems to resolve disputes about property ownership.\""}, {"text": "3.3 Life's War against Entropy\n\n3.3.1 To Live is to Project Power\n\n\"Among the first resources that would likely qualify as being owned by life were mineral-rich deposits of nutrients captured from deep-sea hydrothermal vents shortly after the formation of oceans around four billion years ago. Life's first major power projection technology wasn't sharp teeth like what we saw with the example of the wolf in the previous section. Instead, it was a pressurized membrane - little more than a bubble. A pressurized membrane is a wall or thin mass stretched across a volume that exerts force to displace surrounding mass, as illustrated in Figure 9. when external forces from the environment contact a membrane, the membrane exploits Newton's third law to passively project opposing forces back at the environment to displace the mass of the surrounding volume.\""}, {"text": "", "imgs": ["images/helpdesk/softwar_051_image0.jpg"]}, {"text": "\"Early life forms \"owned\" deep-sea hydrothermal nutrients for the same reason a wolf \"owns\" meat: because they had the capacity and inclination to project physical power to succesfully capture and secure their access to it. Since these first little organisms emerged, life's pressurize membrane power projection tactic has evolved and taken many different complex forms over the past four billion years, but the function has not changed. From microscopic bubbles, to armor, to castle walls, to militarized national borders, all pressurized membranes work the same way: they passively project physical power to gain and maintain access to precious resources. These resources are captured by force. Period.\"\n\n\"Abiogenesis reminds us that living is an act of projecting physical power to capture physical resources. Life physically captures the oxygen it breathes by force. Life physically captures the food it eats by force. Life physically captures the volume it occupies by force. What life needs to survive is \"owned\" for no other reason than the fact that life has the capacity and inclinationto project power to capture it. A quick glance into the night sky reminds us that the universe does not owe us our lives; we have what we have because we take it using physical power. As discussed in chapter 4, the rest of what we believe about resource ownership is abstract.\""}, {"text": "3.3.2 To Live is to Convert Chaos into Structure\n\n\"The emergent behavior of life is something remarkable. By projecting lots of physical power to capture and secure access to resources, life is miraculously able to turn the inexorable chaos of the universe into something more structured. It then leverages that structure to exert more more physical power to capture more resources and convert those resources into even more structure. Life owes its existence and prosperity to this process. Few things are as aligned with the fundamental nature of all living things than this physical power projection process through which organisms secure access to resources and then use those resources to build additional structures, for no other discernable reason than to simply improve its ability to countervail entropy and survive a little longer.\""}, {"text": "", "imgs": ["images/helpdesk/softwar_051_image0.jpg"]}, {"text": "\"Under the protection of their pressurized membranes, these new global superpowers were able to form highly complex internal microorganic economies, Subcellular molecules self-assembled into increasingly more specialized workforces, trading various microorganic good and services and becoming ever more efficient, productive, and resource abundant.

In other words, animal packs don't reward their most powerful and aggressive members with feeding and breeding rights because it's the \"right\" thing to do - they do it because all the animals that didn't do it didn't survive.\"\n\n\"Sapiens have shown it's possible to change a wild animal pack's pecking order heuristics by genetically entrapping and enslaving the.

So for the sake\nof fairness, it should also be the case that the creation of money\nitself takes time and work.\n\nBut this is not the case with national currencies. Any arbitrary\namount of dollars, euros, pesos, pounds, etc.. can be conjured\nout of thin air instantly and with no work. The creation of this\nkind of money is therefore not tied to time and work. And so,\nthis method of the creation of money discourages people from\nworking. It instead encourages people to seek handouts of this\neasy money. This isn’t just welfare for the poor — it is mostly\nhuge handouts for the very rich.\n\nBitcoin fixes this.\n\nCreating bitcoins requires time. Bitcoin, the system, guarantees\nthat bitcoins, its unit of currency, can only be created over a\npreset schedule of time. A small amount of bitcoin is created\nevery ten minutes on average, with that amount getting cut in\nhalf every four years, leading to a maximum supply of 21 million\nbitcoins ever.\n\nAnd creating bitcoins also requires work. Nobody can conjure\nbitcoins without proving that they worked to create them. The\ncreation of bitcoins is a giant competition between workers all\nover the world to win each reward that is won every ten minutes\non average. The more competitors and the more work they do,\nthe harder it gets to win.\n\nSo if you put in your time and your energy to earn money,\nwouldn’t you want to choose a money that also requires the\npeople who create it to have to put in their time and energy too?\nThat money is Bitcoin and it is the only money in the world now\nthat gives fair treatment to people who put in their time and\nenergy to earn money."}, {"text": "<@456226577798135808> I have a feeling you can contribute a lot to this thread.

The block header includes the time stamp down to the second. The two other variables that can be changed are the nonce field and the input of the coinbase transaction (can be thought of as a second nonce). Therefore, each second there are a 2^96 different combinations of the block header that can be hashed to try and find a solution (which may not be found by that miner at all that second). The next second the timestamp variable will be different, so all the hashes will be completely different. Since it is impossible to predict patterns based on inputs into the hash, no patterns can be identified over time either.
