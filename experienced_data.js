      {text:'*(under construction)*\n\n<b>THE PROBLEM OF TODAY\'S MONEY (AND WHY BITCOIN IS THE SOLUTION)</b>\n\n"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."\n- Henry Ford\n\n\n70% of ALL USD in circulation was created after 2008.\nOver 40% since 2020\nIt\'s getting worse and worse \n\nFiat currency in the United States started about 100 years ago.\n\nQuick history of the dollar: https://stacker.news/items/3009\n\nThe dollar as defined by the Constitution is a "weight of gold or silver." In 1913, the government inserted a permanent central bank called Federal Reserve to stand in between the Constitution and the people. This was the introduction of "the Fed dollar" or fiat currency. It is not a Constitutional dollar; it is a note that is issued by the Federal Reserve. This also gave the right to the Federal Reserve to print money whenever they wanted to.  *One dollar today was worth $0.04 in 1913, a reduction of purchasing power by 96%*\n\nIn the years past The Great Depression, through WWII, and after, the United States traded cash for gold from citizen and other nations. Eventually, those nations started asking for their gold back.\nIn 1971 President Nixon decided to cut off other nations from their gold and we got off the Gold Standard. This is known as "The Nixon Shock." Our money wasn\'t backed by gold anymore. Instead, it was backed solely by the full faith and credit of the United States government. You had to trust the government. And while it helped America grow as a superpower … and helped many of us live lives of exorbitant privilege …It’s also responsible for the mess we’re in today. And it’s what will ultimately topple the US dollar. They say those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it. But politicians know their history.',link:'https://stacker.news/items/3009'},
      {text:'They know that inflating the money supply is what ultimately kills it. They either just can’t help themselves - or they actually want our currency to collapse. There’s no rolling this back, either. The damage is already done. The US dollar is a ‘dead man walking’. And the only thing that can save America itself is bitcoin.\n\nWhen our government needs money, they create bonds or treasury bills and then sell them to large banks who sell them to the Federal Reserve for a profit. This is the "Magic Money Machine." The Fed is America\'s central bank, but it doesn\'t have any money on its balance sheets. When a bank buys a bond and takes it to the Federal Reserve, the Fed says, "Thanks Mr. Banker, here\'s the principal and some profit." New money isn\'t exchanged, it simply appears on the banks accounts- magic. This has been happening in secret for 100 years. This is where it gets really interesting. The Federal Reserve is not a government agency. It\'s a private entity. Its shareholders are banks who earn a dividend. This process answers to no one. And the Fed also sets the bar for how much interest you pay for a car, home or business loan. \n\nFractional reserve banking - means that banks only store a portion of our money while lending out way more (further debasing our money). Today, when you deposit $100 into a bank, the bank has the power to do whatever it wants with it. It can even take that $100 and loan $97 out to another person. The bank still says that you have $100...but it also says that the other person has $97 (it\'s all digital). Then, that person has to pay interest to the bank on that $97. The person then spends those $97 to some shop. That shop then deposits the $97 into a bank. Then the bank lends most of that money out too! This happens again and again...new money created from debt!'},
      {text:'If you are deemed "credit worthy" by a bank, you can take out a loan where a bank creates money out of no where and charges you interest for it...giving more money to the banks!\n\nIf everyone who had money in banks requested 3% of their money in cash, the banks would not be able to do it.\n\n2008 financial crisis: Banks loaned out too much money to people who couldn\'t afford to pay it back. 30 million jobs were destroyed. The US lost $16 trillion in household wealth. The banks foreclosed on over 1 million homes. Were the banks punished for their actions? No, in fact, they were bailed out!\n\nNeed to mention: Debasement by Qualitative easing (QE) and the constant printing of USD by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Negative interest rates.  The playbook is as follows: increase the money supply, reduce interest rates and reflate asset values such that existing debt levels can be sustained and more debt can be created. However, despite record low interest rates, the global economy has once again begun to deteriorate and the effectiveness of quantitative easing is naturally being questioned by many. Contrary to popular belief, the function of quantitative easing actually creates the instability it seeks to avoid. When understanding its base operation, it becomes clear that quantitative easing has always been a fool’s errand. Quantitative easing is designed to allow banks to expand credit; for every dollar that is created through quantitative easing, the credit system can expand by multiples of each dollar added. This incremental credit (think auto loans, mortgages, student loans, etc.) is then used to purchase goods in the real economy, which causes the prices of goods to rise and the value of the dollar to decline on a relative basis.'},
      {text:'Our monetary policies have created a nation of debtors. Not just personal debt or cooperate debt, but government debt. What is the wealth of the nation? It is simply a gigantic hole of money that we owe to the world that is never going to be paid back. The US pays more than $400 billion in interest to its creditors every year. When a government spends more money than it collects in taxes, it just borrows or prints more. (see US current debt: https://www.usdebtclock.org/)\n\nSolution: Bitcoin via properties of Thermodynamics (first and third). See explanation here: https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-and-thermodynamics-63f46b90627\n\nIf we can fix the money, we can fix the world. For the last century, the government has had full control of our money because they control the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve controls the money printer. Whoever controls the money printer controls everything. Decisions that influence our cultures, the food we eat, the education we receive, the energy that we have and can use, poverty levels as well as political imbalance, greed and corruption and more is all out of our control. There is a reason why some financial institutions like Goldman Sachs are still prospering while others like the Lehman Brothers went out of business- the government decided to print money for one of them and not the other. There is a reason why some areas of the country suffer from higher levels of poverty and get less educational funding than others- can you guess why?\n\nWe need to end the printing of money. We need to take back control from the government. We need to shut down Keynesian, Marxist and Monetarist economists and other proponents of the state theory of money who believe money is whatever the state says is money, and therefore it is the prerogative of the state to do with it as it pleases, which is going to inevitably mean printing it to spend on achieving state objectives, hurting the motives of our politicians and weakening our Democracy.',link:'https://www.usdebtclock.org/)'},
      {text:'We need to adopt Austrian Economics advocating for no government control over our money. As the saying goes, "Bitcoin fixes this." The Austrian theory of money posits that money emerges in a market as the most marketable commodity and most salable asset, the one asset whose holders can sell with the most ease, in favorable conditions. Bitcoin is sound money because of its fixed supply. When people store their value in Bitcoin, it will retain its purchasing power over time. Bitcoin allows everyone in the world access to a free market. There is a way out of the fiat system, and it is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is resurrecting what money used to be all about. It is money with real value.\n\nThroughout history, money from taxes and government bonds have financed wars. Just take a look at this chart: https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874319602811801670/875572406612283432\n\nWe are living in an amazing time period where three revolutionary cycles are converging. The financial market resets every 80 years. A technological revolution happens every 50 years or so. We have a political/social/cultural revolution every 250 years. It seems like every 250 years, the world rejects globalism and more centralization and moves to decentralization. The American/French resolution happed 250 years ago and 250 years before that was the Protestant Reformation. Most people are looking for a centralized answer- will the dollar remain? Will it be the Chinese Yuan? Will it be an SDR? I think the world will be decentralized with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Standard.\n\nMention Bitcoin\'s involvement in geopolitics. If two governments of two nations don\'t get along, money simply doesn\'t flow across their boarders. To give an example of how this applies: if you wanted to give a dollar to someone via the internet, almost half of the world can\'t receive it from you. Bitcoin fixes this.',link:'https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874319602811801670/875572406612283432'},

What ends up happening is hundreds if not thousands of people will die. With currency controls comes the short notice of government devaluing certain bill denominations (like India just did to the 500 rupee note) and closing the banks for days. When the banks finally open, people have to wait in long lines to withdraw what little funds they still have to pay medical bills. When they can\'t get their money in time, their family members die.

Here is an example. Bitcoin is an interesting vehicle for freedom because nothing has ever existed like it before. Normally, to raise money for a human rights group, people have to beg for money with non profit work to get people to make a difference with you. With Bitcoin, it is an asset that most people want to accumulate out of self interest, self preservation and greed, yet hidden underneath this investment is a strengthening force to power the individual. This is what we need to fight "big brother." It\'s hard to really care about struggling people living thousands of miles away. But with Bitcoin, it makes the process a lot easier.

First of all, your coins should not be left on an exchange. As the saying goes, "not your keys, not your coins." What this means is that actually owning your Bitcoin means you are fully in control of your private keys that give you access to your digital property (your Bitcoin). By leaving your Bitcoin on an exchange, you are in essence trusting that exchange with your private keys. God forbid something happen to that exchange, they have the right to withhold your Bitcoin indefinitely, or worse, they could lose your coins permanently due to a hack or some related catastrophe.\n\nYour password for your bitcoin is what is known as your private keys. Never tell your private keys to anyone. Never store them on the internet or take a picture of them. If they are off the internet and not stored anywhere they can\'t be hacked. Instead. just write them down and store it in a safe (preferably fireproof). If you lose or forget your private keys, your coins are likely lost forever. However, I have learned about a service called KeychainX that works to recover forgotten pins. There may be hope if all else fails.'},

      {text:'<b>KYC</b>\n\n*(under construction)*\n\nKYC stands for "know your customer." For tax purposes as well as anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and counter terrorism financing (CTF) laws, custodial/regulated exchanges are forced to obtain personal identification from its users such as name, birthday, cell number, social security number, and photo ID.\n\nFor privacy reasons, it is recommended that advanced Bitcoiners start to stack non-KYC Bitcoin (also known as "secret sats"). There are multiple ways to do this.\n\nMining Bitcoin is an easy (but not so easy) way to earn KYC-free Bitcoin. See more in <#874331239081975929> \n\nBitcoin ATMs can also be used to purchase Non-KYC Bitcoin, find one near you here:\nhttps://coinatmradar.com/ \nSome Bitcoin ATMs require SMS verification. In order to stay KYC-free, you\'ll need to use either a burner phone not connected to your ID or the website https://textverified.com/ Also, make sure that the email address associated with your account and money you send to TextVerified isn\'t tied to your identity. You can pay in Bitcoin. I sent Bitcoin to my account via a lightning wallet that isn\'t tied to my identity. As you can see, getting KYC-free Bitcoin is a pain in the ass. On top of this struggle, Bitcoin ATMs charge outrageously high fees...usually around 8.4%.\n\nNon-KYC Bitcoin should be kept separately in a different wallet than your KYC Bitcoin; don\'t mix the stacks. Your non-KYC wallet should not be linked to your identity in any way else it ruins the purpose of a non-KYC stack. \n\nMore on KYC: \nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-will-protect-your-personal-data\n\nLots of resources/information on the process of purchasing Non-KYC Bitcoin here: \nhttps://99bitcoins.com/buy-bitcoin/anonymously-without-id/',link:'https://coinatmradar.com/'},

      {text:'<b>NODES</b>\n\n*(under construction)*\n\nThe Bitcoin nodes are simply computers that contain the Bitcoin Core code and the complete Bitcoin Blockchain (the transactional ledger/records history of transactions). There are currently about 14,000 Bitcoin nodes worldwide which speaks to the real decentralization and security of the Bitcoin network. There is no single point of failure to shut down Bitcoin. Nuclear war could (God forbid) wipe out 3/4 of the planet, but as long as one Bitcoin node is still functional, Bitcoin will continue to run uninterrupted. You could even find the first computer that ever downloaded the Bitcoin code (if it still exists) and destroy it; that wont matter. Bitcoin can not be stopped or deleted.\n\n<b>WHAT NODES DO</b>\nNodes validate and process transactions on the Bitcoin network. When a bitcoin transactions happens, every node gets a veto to decide if this transaction was valid. They need to come to a full consensus on this vote- if any node decides a transaction is invalid, then the transaction doesn\'t actually occur. The role of a node is to communicate with the other nodes in the network directly, verifying that their history of transactions is aligned with the next node. As they verify new transactions, they check to see that the bitcoin being transacted has not been double-spent and that no bitcoin is being created out of thin air. If a node does see malicious transaction attempts, it along with the other nodes in the network will reject the transactions. Users (nodes), not miners or developers, decide which blocks are valid and which software to run.'},

      {text:'<b>BITCOIN MINERS</b>\n\n*(under construction)*\n\nMiners decide on the order of transactions and confirm them by using the Proof of Work consensus algorithm to "mine" for new blocks for the blockchain. In essence, mining secures the Bitcoin network. This process uses lots of energy (mostly sustainable energy and lots of energy that would otherwise be wasted and/or returned hazardously (flare gas, carbon or stranded hydro-electric) to the environment!) in the form of electricity to solve a math problem (basically by guessing a certain number to solve a puzzle algorithm). Once a computer guesses the correct number by executing the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256) hashing function, the other miners will quickly validate this, and when it is accepted, a new block will be added to the blockchain. The miner (or mining pool) who successfully added the new block, gets a reward of (currently) 6.25 Bitcoin plus all the transaction fees for that block. This process happens roughly every 10 minutes (which is also known as the heartbeat of Bitcoin).'},
      {text:'<b>MEMPOOL</b>\nThe “holding area” of unconfirmed transactions in a Bitcoin node’s memory, waiting to be picked up by a Bitcoin miner and inserted into a block.\n\n<b>DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT</b>\nThe code also has a difficulty adjustment that syncs every 2,016 block (approximately 2 weeks). What this does is it keeps the average block time to 10 minutes. If over the span of two weeks more mining power is added to the network, then the mining time will likely be below 10 minutes so the difficulty adjustment will make the algorithm a bit harder so the average time will likely go back up closer to 10 minutes for the next 2 weeks. This recalibration maintains the 10 minute "heartbeat" of Bitcoin.\n\nThe difficulty level as of August 2020 is more than 16 trillion. That is, the chance of a computer producing a hash below the target is 1 in 16 trillion. To put that in perspective, you are about 44,500 times more likely to win the Powerball jackpot with a single lottery ticket than you are to pick the correct hash on a single try. Fortunately, mining computer systems spit out many hash possibilities. Nonetheless, mining for bitcoin requires massive amounts of energy and sophisticated computing operations.\n\nThe maximum difficulty level is 2^224, an unimaginably enormous number that would take an unimaginably enormous amount of computing power to achieve. More on the difficulty adjustment: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty\n\n\n<b>MINING REWARD</b>\nThe mining reward gets halved every 210,000 blocks (or roughly 4 years). The reward started at 50 Bitcoin when Bitcoin went live in 2009. The halving process will end in the year 2140 when all 21,000,000 Bitcoin have successfully been mined.  From then on, the mining reward will only be transaction fees which should be fine considering there will be millions and millions of transactions every block by the time hyperbicoinization comes to fruition!',link:'https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty'},

However, because the network is already so large and the value of Bitcoin has been and is rising tremendously, Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you have cheap (or no) electricity costs and can invest $16,000+ (my estimate) in equipment. You also have the option to join a mining pool, where rewards are shared based on your contributing hash rate.

An ASIC is a device programmed to do one very specific thing very fast and efficient, in this case, solve the SHA-256 mining algorithm. A new ASIC device can cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to $10,000, but the price of mining hardware is only a fraction of the expense involved. ASICs consume tremendous amounts of electricity, the cost of which can quickly exceed the cost of the device using it.\n\nCurrently, the hashing rate of the network is over 100 terahashes/second. Even if you can afford the initial investment at low electricity costs, it would still take about one year to turn a profit. Other than that, there is no reason to get involved in mining other than as a hobby for fun.\nHere is quick and easy way to mine from your computer for fun (this is in no way profitable).

      {text:'<b>Proof of Work</b>\nBitcoin uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism/security protocol. Proof of Work is a brilliant mechanism because it bridges a connection between the digital world of the Bitcoin network to the physical world we live. It does this through work/effort by means of electricity output through computational power executing the hashing algorithm called SHA-256. All users in a PoW system have an equal voice, no matter how much of the coin you own. If you run a node, you get a vote. Nodes validate transactions and miners lump those transactions into blocks and are incentivized to do so which secures the network. It is a synergistic system. Everyone works together and benefits.'},
      {text:'<b>Proof of Stake</b>\nProof of stake (PoS) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency. PoS consumes less energy than PoW, but this doesn\'t mean that PoW is a bad thing. More on this coming. PoS is vastly inferior to PoW when it comes to decentralization because with PoS, the largest bag holders get a larger stake in decisions concerning consensus rules. If you own most of the coins in a PoS protocol, your word means more than anyone else. This is not the case in a PoW system.'},

    msgs: [
      {text:'<b>ENERGY CONCERNS</b>\nGlobally, Bitcoin mining consumes an estimated 100-150 terawatt hours (TwH) per year which is 0.1% of global energy usage. However, despite consistent scrutiny from the media and many politicians, using a great deal of energy is not a crime. Also, for comparison, the online advertising agency was uses 100+ TwH/year (a large percentage of that is also spam), the cruise ship industry uses 250 TwH per year, and "always on" devices in homes use 1,375 TwH/year. Christmas lights in the US alone even consume more energy than the Bitcoin network. So the question comes down to this: can the value that the Bitcoin network provides be justified to be more valuable than the value of something like Christmas lights? \n\nBitcoin uses proof of work. This is proof of energy. To consider the value of Bitcoin, let me start with an example of another currency. Wampum is a traditional shell bead of the Eastern Woodlands tribes of Native Americans that has been used as currency as early as the 1600s. It takes time and energy to make wampum, which is why it is considered to have value. The same can be said about Bitcoin. It takes time and effort (energy) to produce bitcoin. Bitcoin is only rewarded when a miner can prove that they have done a certain amount of work through electricity, processes and code. No state or authority has ever instructed or forced anyone to mine bitcoin. Mining is an activity carried out by individuals in response to the organic emerging demand for bitcoin.'},
      {text:'Bitcoin miners need to find low cost energy to get an edge and turn a profit. Despite state coal subsidies in some countries, this now means miners need to turn to efficient, clean energy. Wind, solar, and especially hydro, as well as flared natural gas and geothermal (even from dormant volcanos like in El Salvador!) become the priority. Because of the way rewards work for mining, miners have a direct incentive to find the cheapest energy available, and in a lot of cases, the cheapest energy is renewables. We\'ve been seeing miners over the past decade shift to cheaper, renewable forms of energy because it makes economic sense. An estimated 39% of Bitcoin\'s energy use is currently renewable, and that percentage is growing larger every day. It is believed that Bitcoin mining will one day be 100% renewable. General energy use worldwide is only 11% renewable. \n\nMore than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it\'s produced during the hours of the day when there isn\'t a demand to consume it. It is also produced in a place where there\'s not transmission to move it across space and time, so that energy goes unused and wasted. It is a misnomer that Bitcoin is using all the energy of a country like Switzerland, for example. Technically, that may be true, but that\'s not the whole story. You have to realize that a lot of the energy Bitcoin is consuming is waste energy that wasn\'t even available to be consumed in the first place!'},
      {text:'Citizens of countries that have volcanos, hydro plants, and wind and solar farms are often far away from population centers. So what this will allow is electrification of new areas which will create new economic activity. So for a country like El Salvador, communities in the mountains and by the rivers can get a jump start. Where there\'s Bitcoin mining, there are people who need food, new housing developments, and new jobs. Just like how mankind developed along rivers throughout our history, we could develop future activity around Bitcoin mining. Once an industry begins to grow, there\'s an entire ecosystem that builds around it. It\'s not just the miners, it\'s the skilled workers working around energy systems as well as electricians and supporting businesses through manufacturing and skills. \n\nIn places like Congo, only 9% of the population of 90 million people have access to the electricity grid. This causes an enormous amount of deforestation because they get their energy from biofuels by cutting down trees and producing charcoal which also produces a lot of indoor air pollution that kills lots of children. If all of a sudden this other 91% of the population used hydro electricity instead of biofuels, that would be a massive difference maker for the environment and all the people. Focusing energy usage around Bitcoin can help us get there!'},
      {text:'Bitcoin\'s demand for the most efficient power pushes miners to innovate, obtaining power that is either wasted, like trapped methane, stranded, like remote volcanos, or simply efficient and therefore clean. In contrast with gold, the search for which leads to more dirty, wasteful mines, the search for Bitcoin appears to lead to greener and more efficient energy production.\n\nBitcoin miners are also very mobile. They can move to where the power is. You can set up your mining facility very close to the source of power generation, even directly on a volcano! This is unique to Bitcoin mining. Normally, when you generate power, you need to move it somewhere else like to a city or an industrial facility. You can locate Bitcoin mining directly to where the power is! It doesn\'t have to be near population centers. Bitcoin miners can help bootstrap new types of energy in new locations, especially in developing areas. For example, Bitcoin miners are moving to Wyoming, Texas, and Alberta where oil rigs flare off huge quantities of waste methane. They capture this methane with portable mining equipment. Not only are they taking the natural gas and using it as electricity, they are capturing the carbon and put it underground (not venting it and creating acid rain and CO2). This helps the environment and turns a profit at the same time!'},

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol for money in the network age. It solves many problems that plague our world, see <#875000313092902942> Therefore, its energy use is definitely justified.'},

      {text:'<b>LAYERS</b>\nMaintaining a solid, secure and reliable network on Bitcoin Layer 1 means that people can safely innovate on additional layers built on top of Bitcoin. These additional layers are home to many different types of innovations. It is impossible to predict exactly what will be built in the future, but if what\'s been done so far is any indication, we can expect some tremendous things to come. \n\n<b>LIGHTNING NETWORK</b>\nThe Lightning Network is a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that helps Bitcoin scale and enables low fee, extremely fast (and as I\'ve witnessed, seemingly instantaneous) transactions. Lightning was made possible after Bitcoin\'s SegWit upgrade. \n\nThe easiest way to understand how Lighting works is comparing it to opening a tab at a bar. You buy drinks one at a time and eventually settle your transactions at the end of the night. Similarly, with lightning, you can transact a bunch of times and settle later.\n\nThe Lightning Network is similar to a “data link” layer in that it allows communication between nodes for final settlement. The clearest difference between the Lightning Network and Fedwire though is that you need to be a bank to participate in the Fedwire system, whereas basically anyone can open a Lightning channel, without permission required. Fedwire communicates between banks, Lightning communicates between anybody that wants a channel.\n\nIt is important to note that two transacting lightning channel balances can adjust in milliseconds and do not require immediate settlement on the base layer. The transactions made in a Lightning channel do not exist on-chain, but the final balance of the channel is eventually broadcasted on-chain when a channel is closed.'},
      {text:'Lightning actually processes transactions one million times more energy efficient than Visa, and it is open to the billions in the world without access to a bank account.

Transactions happen over and over again on the Lightning Network and eventually get settled at the base layer, like at the end of the night when you pay your bar tab.\n\nAnother great thing about the Lightning Network is that it is built on top of the Bitcoin\'s base layer meaning it has all properties of the base layer (decentralization, high security, immutability, etc.). Feel free to mention the Lightning Network to anyone who claims that Bitcoin\'s transaction speeds are too slow- this is a myth!\n\n<b>PRIVACY</b>\nAdditionally, transacting with Lightning is very private.

A sidechain is another blockchain that is linked to a main chain such as Bitcoin’s. They are linked with a two-way peg (2WP) that is a protocol that allows for the open transfer of cryptocurrency from the main chain to a layer two chain that requires a degree of third-party trust.\n\nOne example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network, attached to Bitcoin’s main chain. Like other layer 2 scaling solutions, it aims to tackle scalability problems by offloading some of the validation and transaction processing processes to another blockchain. This frees up the main chain to take on a greater number of transactions.\n\n<b>RSK</b>\nLaunched in 2018, RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain which can support Ethereum smart contracts. The RSK sidechain is “merge mined” with Bitcoin, meaning miners who mine Bitcoin\'s blockchain also contribute hash rate to mine blocks on RSK.\n\n@RSKsmart (twitter)\nhttps://www.rsk.co/\n\nRSK\'s YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RskSmart/videos',link:'https://www.rsk.co/',imgs:['images/experienced/layer-3-sidechains_209_layer-3-sidechains_rsk.jpg']},

    msgs: [
      {text:'<b>BLOCKCHAIN</b>\nA blockchain is a specific type of database. For Bitcoin, this database is a time-stamped ledger that keeps a historical record of the transactions on the network. As the name suggests, blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block which makes the data chained together in chronological order (complete with a timestamp). Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as a ledger (record keeper) for transactions like it is for Bitcoin.\n\nIt has recently come to my attention that Satoshi originally called what we call the Blockchain, the Timechain. From here on out, when you refer to the Bitcoin Blockchain, you should call it the *Timechain*! See here for more (also posted in <#874623041810890813>): https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1106028072799744002\n\nBitcoin timestamps each block using Unix (UTC) timestamps.\n\n<b>BUZZ WORD</b>\nThe word, "blockchain," is being thrown around all over the place in this space, but people don\'t really know what it is (and more importantly, what it is not). A blockchain is not revolutionary tech in and of itself. Enterprise, permissioned blockchains were all the rage a few years ago and all of a sudden the buzz word is back. Many companies like IBM and Microsoft created their own blockchain teams under the belief that “blockchain, not Bitcoin” was the real innovative tech that would change the world. Years later, many of these companies have shut down their blockchain teams entirely. These companies could have saved a whole lot of money and time if they had just read this Jimmy Song blog post (April 14th, 2018) about why blockchains are pretty much useless for everything except money, like Bitcoin: https://jimmysong.medium.com/why-blockchain-is-hard-60416ea4c5c',link:'https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1106028072799744002'},
      {text:'<b>BLOCK SIZE</b>\nEach block in the Bitcoin Blockchain has a size of 1 MB (megabyte). Each block typically contains 1000-2000 transactions. The transactions awaiting verification/confirmation from the miners and the node operators are held in what is called the mempool. Currently, the entire Blockchain, which includes every single transaction that has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network up to the present moment (which updates automatically on all <#874331220618670120>), is over 300 GB. Satoshi knew that a block size larger than 1 MB would be inefficient (storage wise) as the nodes running the network wouldn\'t be able to cost effectively store the Blockchain if the blocks were larger. There was great controversy on this topic which led to a Bitcoin hard fork in 2017 called Bitcoin Cash. More on this hard fork can be found in <#874623041810890813> (Block Size Wars (2015 - 2017)).'},
      {text:'<b>DON\'T TRUST, VERIFY</b>\nThe Bitcoin code is full of many consensus rules. Two of them that derive from Blockchain technology are, "Is this Bitcoin that is being transacted with consistent with the fixed supply of 21 million coins, and has it previously been spent?" This way, if I have bitcoin and I send it to two different people at the same time, the network will know which of these transactions occured first, therefore identifying both the valid transaction and invalid transaction (which it will automatically reject). Nodes don\'t need to trust other nodes for this to work; they only need verify that sufficient Proof of Work (spent energy/electricity) was done to create the new block. The longest chain is what individual nodes accept as the valid version of the Blockchain. The rule that nodes adopt the longest chain of blocks allows every node on the network to agree on what the Blockchain looks like, and therefore agree on the same transaction history. And as we know, since the network is decentralized, all of this can be done without a trusted third party!\n\nIn Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone. Form more on this, see <#874446496500703263>.'},

      {text:'<b>SOFT VS HARD FORKS</b>\nA soft fork is a voluntary, backwards-compatible upgrade. A hard fork requires every node in the network that wants to stay active to upgrade its software.\n\n*SOFT FORK EXAMPLES*\n- Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) (2012) - Allowed transactions to be sent to a script hash (address starting with 3) instead of a public key hash (addresses starting with 1). Using P2SH, you can send bitcoins to an address that is secured in various unusual ways without knowing anything about the details of how the security is set up\n- Segregated Witness (SegWit) (2017) - Aims to reduce the size of each bitcoin transaction, thereby allowing more transactions to take place at once\n- Taproot (2021) - Adds support for Schnorr signatures, and improves functionality of smart contracts and the Lightning Network. Also improves privacy\n\n*HARD FORK EXAMPLES*\n- Bitcoin XT (2014, now dead) - increased block size from one megabyte to eight megabytes .

      {text:'<b>*I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Do your own research.</b>*\n\n<b>1. LUMP SUM 2. DCA 3. HODL</b>\n\nWhat I\'ve learned is that the BEST way to approach investing in Bitcoin (and most other assets) is to first lump sum as much money as you possibly can as soon as you possibly can. From there, dollar cost average (DCA) either daily or weekly (daily has shown to provide better returns than weekly). The easiest way to daily DCA is through my SWAN referral link here: https://www.swanbitcoin.com/philfaz. \nThen simply HODL (hold your investment/don\'t sell it) for at least 4 years (through one complete Bitcoin cycle). \nThe HODL Commandments:\nhttps://bholr.com\n\nIf you follow this strategy, history (as well as the math/code) complete with a limited supply and high demand proves that you will make a nice return on your investment. This is the strategy I use. Personally, I don\'t plan on selling ANY of my Bitcoin for at least 10 years. I treat my stack as a long term savings account. No one who has invested money in Bitcoin and held for at least 3 years has lost any money. In fact, the average annual return of a bitcoin investment is 100-200%. Bitcoin will one day absorb all the world\'s wealth. As they say, ∞/21MM, meaning that all existing and future value divided by the 21 million BTC supply equals bitcoin\'s true value- a number so immense that denominating in USD doesn\'t even make sense. This of course, is not financial advice. All investments come with risk.\n\nLump sum > DCA research: https://twitter.com/w_s_bitcoin/status/1489707655488802821?s=20&t=yaYraSRSkL-PZ99TJOm08w\nResearch that supports this strategy: https://ofdollarsanddata.com/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum/\nMore research: https://eng.ambcrypto.com/should-you-buy-bitcoin-daily-or-weekly/\nEven more research: https://shitcoin.ninja/post/2019/10/comparing-bitcoin-investment-strategies/\nMore:\nhttps://bitcoinist.com/latest-research-compares-bitcoin-btc-investment-strategies/',link:'https://www.swanbitcoin.com/philfaz.'},
      {text:'<b>DIVERSIFICATION</b>\nIf you\'ve invested in anything before like maybe the stock market, you might have heard from someone that it is a good idea to "diversify your portfolio." While diversifying does decrease your risk of losing everything, I do not believe this is a good practice to follow in the cryptocurrency market. Again, this is not financial advice, but let me ask you: If you made a bet at a horse race, would you put small  bets on most of the horses...or a reasonable sized bet on the horse you think has the best chance to win? With this idea in mind, you should be investing everything into the cryptocurrency that will win. I do believe that to be Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.\n\n<b>YIELD & LEVERAGE</b>\nThe longer you\'re in this space, the longer you\'ll be tempted to loan out your Bitcoin with the temptation to earn a fabulous yield. The yields advertised by services like BlockFi, Celcius, Voyager, Nexo, etc. are much higher than what you\'d receive from a traditional bank savings account. This seems too good to be true, right? In a way, it is. You see, when you sign up for these services, you are loaning your Bitcoin to them so that they can turn a profit by using it on their end. As the saying goes, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. If something were to happen to the platform you\'re using, they have the right to withhold you from withdrawing your Bitcoin indefinitely. This will be laid out to you word-for-word in their terms of service. This is very dangerous, and I do not recommend messing with it at all. It is not worth risking your Bitcoin stack that is already appreciating 100-200% per year for an additional 5%.'},
      {text:'You can also borrow against your Bitcoin (tax free) as shown here (Michael Saylor strategy). Personally, I probably will never do this because it means you have to give up full control of your stack. But here is a resource if you are interested: https://youtu.be/OvAEQhbuvMI.\n\nAnother option you have is to take a loan in fiat to buy bitcoin. In my eyes, if you can afford the minimum payments of the loan, then I see no problem in doing this. Again, this is NOT financial advice. But say you can get a loan for 12% interest, if you believe that Bitcoin can overperform that 12% over an extended amount of time, then why not take the loan?
