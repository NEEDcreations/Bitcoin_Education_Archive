Rothbard offers a third alternative to the conventional interpretive devices. Against those on the right who see the American Revolution as a \"conservative\" event, and those on the left who want to invoke it as some sort of proto-socialist uprising, Rothbard views this period as a time of accelerating libertarian radicalism. Through this prism, Rothbard illuminates events as never before.\n\nThe volumes were brought out in the 1970s, but the odd timing and uneven distribution prevented any kind of large audience. They were beloved only by a few specialists, and sought after by many, thanks to their outstanding reputation. The Mises Institute is pleased to be the publisher of this integrated book.\n\nThis single volume covers the discovery of the Americas and the colonies in the 17th century, the period of \"salutary neglect\" in the first half of the 18th century, the advance to revolution, from 1760-1775 and the political, military, and ideological history of the revolution and after.","link":"https://archive.org/details/ConceivedInLiberty","imgs":["images/resources/books_0218_books_default.jpg"]},{"text":"Fresh (free) Soft War links (Jason Lowery) \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15uMzo9qbV-GY4xNH7ZhenXuE_q5xO4ZL/view?pli=1\nhttps://aul.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/01AUL_INST:AUL/1297573990006836","link":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15uMzo9qbV-GY4xNH7ZhenXuE_q5xO4ZL/view?pli=1"}]}
