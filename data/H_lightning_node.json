Without the full on chain one?\n2- The videos I watch are for people from Canada or US, with super fast internet, even with that speed the node takes about 3 to 4 days to download and sync, so I almost always say, if these guys with such speeds take that long, it surely needs about 2 months for me to setup my own node hahaha, and so after that I go and stop thinking about that idea. \nWhat do you guys think? Can people with slow internet have a node of their own?\nThank youuuu"}, {"text": "A Lightning node is a node + channels that route transactions. So the answer to your first question is no.
