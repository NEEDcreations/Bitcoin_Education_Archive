These additional layers are home to many different types of innovations. It is impossible to predict exactly what will be built in the future, but if what's been done so far is any indication, we can expect some tremendous things to come. \n\n<b>LIGHTNING NETWORK</b>\nThe Lightning Network is a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that helps Bitcoin scale and enables low fee, extremely fast (and as I've witnessed, seemingly instantaneous) transactions. Lightning was made possible after Bitcoin's SegWit upgrade. \n\nThe easiest way to understand how Lighting works is comparing it to opening a tab at a bar. You buy drinks one at a time and eventually settle your transactions at the end of the night. Similarly, with lightning, you can transact a bunch of times and settle later.\n\nThe Lightning Network is similar to a “data link” layer in that it allows communication between nodes for final settlement. The clearest difference between the Lightning Network and Fedwire though is that you need to be a bank to participate in the Fedwire system, whereas basically anyone can open a Lightning channel, without permission required. Fedwire communicates between banks, Lightning communicates between anybody that wants a channel.\n\nIt is important to note that two transacting lightning channel balances can adjust in milliseconds and do not require immediate settlement on the base layer. The transactions made in a Lightning channel do not exist on-chain, but the final balance of the channel is eventually broadcasted on-chain when a channel is closed."}, {"text": "Lightning actually processes transactions one million times more energy efficient than Visa, and it is open to the billions in the world without access to a bank account. This will enable many people around the world to hurdle banks and jump right into Bitcoin. Andreas prophesizes that kids born today wont have bank accounts (or driver's licenses for that matter); find this quoted here: https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874344285623955516/874344376862642227.\n\nTo look at it more simply, using the Lightning Network is like opening a bar tab. Transactions happen over and over again on the Lightning Network and eventually get settled at the base layer, like at the end of the night when you pay your bar tab.\n\nAnother great thing about the Lightning Network is that it is built on top of the Bitcoin's base layer meaning it has all properties of the base layer (decentralization, high security, immutability, etc.). Feel free to mention the Lightning Network to anyone who claims that Bitcoin's transaction speeds are too slow- this is a myth!\n\n<b>PRIVACY</b>\nAdditionally, transacting with Lightning is very private. Lightning transactions are not broadcast on the Blockchain. The sender and receiver are the only two parties who are aware of the lighting transaction that they are making, and in most cases, the receiver doesn't even know who the sender is because the routing among lightning channels is with encrypted data.", "link": "https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874344285623955516/874344376862642227."}, {"text": "Transactions per second:\n• Visa: 1,700\n• MasterCard: 5,000\nBitcoin on Lightning: \n25,000,000+ (25,000+ nodes * 1,000 tps (transactions/sec)\n\nHow to achieve 1,000 tps:\nhttps://bottlepay.com/blog/bitcoin-lightning-benchmarking-performance/\n\n<b>LIGHTNING WALLETS</b>\nThere are many (free) lightning wallet apps that you can get on your phone to transact with small amounts of Bitcoin with little to no fees.
