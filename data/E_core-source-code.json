A hard fork requires every node in the network that wants to stay active to upgrade its software.\n\n*SOFT FORK EXAMPLES*\n- Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) (2012) - Allowed transactions to be sent to a script hash (address starting with 3) instead of a public key hash (addresses starting with 1). Using P2SH, you can send bitcoins to an address that is secured in various unusual ways without knowing anything about the details of how the security is set up\n- Segregated Witness (SegWit) (2017) - Aims to reduce the size of each bitcoin transaction, thereby allowing more transactions to take place at once\n- Taproot (2021) - Adds support for Schnorr signatures, and improves functionality of smart contracts and the Lightning Network. Also improves privacy\n\n*HARD FORK EXAMPLES*\n- Bitcoin XT (2014, now dead) - increased block size from one megabyte to eight megabytes .

Also had a premine\n- Bitcoin SV (2018) - hard fork of Bitcoin Cash with the belief that the scalability features Bitcoin Cash had implemented were not significant enough to meet Bitcoin’s ongoing requirements.
