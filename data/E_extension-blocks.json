The solution generally shares many of the virtues of hard forks: extension blocks allow for almost any protocol change. But they share one significant benefit with soft forks: extension blocks are backward compatible.\n\nWell, sort of …\n\nSoft Forks\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-extension-blocks-are-backward-compatible-and-how-theyre-not","link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-extension-blocks-are-backward-compatible-and-how-theyre-not"},{"text":"Extension Blocks, a solution designed to create larger blockchain blocks by means of a second layer that users opt in to, is available for review with demo functionality and code. The proposal, introduced on GitHub, has gained attention recently since it addresses the need to increase the bitcoin block size without requiring a hard fork.\nhttps://www.ccn.com/extension-blocks-bid-to-increase-blockchain-transaction-capacity-were-available-for-review/","link":"https://www.ccn.com/extension-blocks-bid-to-increase-blockchain-transaction-capacity-were-available-for-review/"},{"text":"For other proposed scaling solutions, see:\n \n \n \nand of course (techinically still in beta)"}]}
