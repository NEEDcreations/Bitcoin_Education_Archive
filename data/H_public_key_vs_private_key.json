Knowing a user's public key is like having your friend's email address. You can send your friend emails which is akin to sending bitcoin to their wallet address or public key. However, you can't send emails from your friends account nor can you read their emails. To send emails, or to send bitcoin somewhere, you need the private key of the address that acts as a password."},{"text":"To confirm a Bitcoin transaction, the sender needs to sign it with his private key. The great part here is that everyone else can verify that the transaction is valid. by seeing the signature and the public key. The verification checks if the signature was used by the private key that belongs to the public key. Asymmetric cryptography makes this verification possible without knowing private key."},{"text":"🙏🏾Thanks for the knowledge. I've always wondered what the difference is but kept procrastinating on checking google for the answer. I should screenshot this."},{"text":"No problem. Yeah lots of these threads were originally just questions that I had haha"},{"text":"Guide on Extended vs Regular public/private keys\nhttps://armantheparman.com/extended_regular_keys/","link":"https://armantheparman.com/extended_regular_keys/","imgs":["images/helpdesk/public_key_vs_private_key_228_public_key_vs_private_key_Screen-Shot-2022-12-08-at-6.31.38-pm.png"]}]}
