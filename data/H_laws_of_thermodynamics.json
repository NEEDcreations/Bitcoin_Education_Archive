Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system.\n\nBitcoin can express how much energy was sacrificed in order to acquire a share of the total sum."}, {"text": "<b>Second Law</b>\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that in a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems never decreases.
