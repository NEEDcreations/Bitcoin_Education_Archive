In essence, mining secures the Bitcoin network. This process uses lots of energy (mostly sustainable energy and lots of energy that would otherwise be wasted and/or returned hazardously (flare gas, carbon or stranded hydro-electric) to the environment!) in the form of electricity to solve a math problem (basically by guessing a certain number to solve a puzzle algorithm). Once a computer guesses the correct number by executing the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256) hashing function, the other miners will quickly validate this, and when it is accepted, a new block will be added to the blockchain. The miner (or mining pool) who successfully added the new block, gets a reward of (currently) 6.25 Bitcoin plus all the transaction fees for that block. This process happens roughly every 10 minutes (which is also known as the heartbeat of Bitcoin)."}, {"text": "<b>MEMPOOL</b>\nThe “holding area” of unconfirmed transactions in a Bitcoin node’s memory, waiting to be picked up by a Bitcoin miner and inserted into a block.\n\n<b>DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT</b>\nThe code also has a difficulty adjustment that syncs every 2,016 block (approximately 2 weeks). What this does is it keeps the average block time to 10 minutes. If over the span of two weeks more mining power is added to the network, then the mining time will likely be below 10 minutes so the difficulty adjustment will make the algorithm a bit harder so the average time will likely go back up closer to 10 minutes for the next 2 weeks. This recalibration maintains the 10 minute \"heartbeat\" of Bitcoin.\n\nThe difficulty level as of August 2020 is more than 16 trillion. That is, the chance of a computer producing a hash below the target is 1 in 16 trillion. To put that in perspective, you are about 44,500 times more likely to win the Powerball jackpot with a single lottery ticket than you are to pick the correct hash on a single try. Fortunately, mining computer systems spit out many hash possibilities. Nonetheless, mining for bitcoin requires massive amounts of energy and sophisticated computing operations.\n\nThe maximum difficulty level is 2^224, an unimaginably enormous number that would take an unimaginably enormous amount of computing power to achieve. More on the difficulty adjustment: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty\n\n\n<b>MINING REWARD</b>\nThe mining reward gets halved every 210,000 blocks (or roughly 4 years). The reward started at 50 Bitcoin when Bitcoin went live in 2009. The halving process will end in the year 2140 when all 21,000,000 Bitcoin have successfully been mined. From then on, the mining reward will only be transaction fees which should be fine considering there will be millions and millions of transactions every block by the time hyperbicoinization comes to fruition!", "link": "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty"}, {"text": "More of Proof of Work: https://medium.com/@julianroberto/understanding-proof-of-work-part-1-586d7ee6b014", "link": "https://medium.com/@julianroberto/understanding-proof-of-work-part-1-586d7ee6b014"}, {"text": "Because of the mining reward, there will always be users of the Bitcoin network that work to validate transactions. The higher the price of a bitcoin goes, the more miners will join to earn the rewards. This is one of the many feedback loops of the Bitcoin network.\n\nTo see how mining actually works on the Bitcoin network, see (highly technical): https://analysis.null.place/how-do-the-bitcoin-mining-algorithms-work/\n\n<b>MINING BITCOIN YOURSELF</b>\nBitcoin mining isn't overly difficult to get started, and I will share some resources to do so in the near future. However, because the network is already so large and the value of Bitcoin has been and is rising tremendously, Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you have cheap (or no) electricity costs and can invest $16,000+ (my estimate) in equipment. You also have the option to join a mining pool, where rewards are shared based on your contributing hash rate. Here are the top mining pools: https://btc.com/stats/pool.", "link": "https://analysis.null.place/how-do-the-bitcoin-mining-algorithms-work/"}, {"text": "The first and most important piece of equipment needed to mine bitcoin is specialized mining hardware called \"application-specific integrated circuits,\" or ASICs. An ASIC is a device programmed to do one very specific thing very fast and efficient, in this case, solve the SHA-256 mining algorithm. A new ASIC device can cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to $10,000, but the price of mining hardware is only a fraction of the expense involved. ASICs consume tremendous amounts of electricity, the cost of which can quickly exceed the cost of the device using it.\n\nCurrently, the hashing rate of the network is over 100 terahashes/second. Even if you can afford the initial investment at low electricity costs, it would still take about one year to turn a profit. Other than that, there is no reason to get involved in mining other than as a hobby for fun.\nHere is quick and easy way to mine from your computer for fun (this is in no way profitable). Just make sure your computer doesn't overheat and watch your electricity bill...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QpgP7XIzxk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QpgP7XIzxk", "imgs": ["images/experienced/mining_228_mining_maxresdefault.jpg"]}, {"text": "If you bought an S19 asic for $15,655, you'd start turning a profit in a little under 2 years.
