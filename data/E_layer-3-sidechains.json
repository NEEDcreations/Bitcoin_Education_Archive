A sidechain is another blockchain that is linked to a main chain such as Bitcoin’s. They are linked with a two-way peg (2WP) that is a protocol that allows for the open transfer of cryptocurrency from the main chain to a layer two chain that requires a degree of third-party trust.\n\nOne example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network, attached to Bitcoin’s main chain. Like other layer 2 scaling solutions, it aims to tackle scalability problems by offloading some of the validation and transaction processing processes to another blockchain. This frees up the main chain to take on a greater number of transactions.\n\n<b>RSK</b>\nLaunched in 2018, RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain which can support Ethereum smart contracts. The RSK sidechain is “merge mined” with Bitcoin, meaning miners who mine Bitcoin's blockchain also contribute hash rate to mine blocks on RSK.\n\n@RSKsmart (twitter)\nhttps://www.rsk.co/\n\nRSK's YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RskSmart/videos", "link": "https://www.rsk.co/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/layer-3-sidechains_209_layer-3-sidechains_rsk.jpg"]}, {"text": "<b>The Liquid Network</b>\nA sidechain-based settlement network for traders & exchanges.
