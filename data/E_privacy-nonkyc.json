There are multiple ways to do this.\n\nMining Bitcoin is an easy (but not so easy) way to earn KYC-free Bitcoin. See more in \n\nBitcoin ATMs can also be used to purchase Non-KYC Bitcoin, find one near you here:\nhttps://coinatmradar.com/ \nSome Bitcoin ATMs require SMS verification. In order to stay KYC-free, you'll need to use either a burner phone not connected to your ID or the website https://textverified.com/ Also, make sure that the email address associated with your account and money you send to TextVerified isn't tied to your identity. You can pay in Bitcoin. I sent Bitcoin to my account via a lightning wallet that isn't tied to my identity. As you can see, getting KYC-free Bitcoin is a pain in the ass. On top of this struggle, Bitcoin ATMs charge outrageously high fees...usually around 8.4%.\n\nNon-KYC Bitcoin should be kept separately in a different wallet than your KYC Bitcoin; don't mix the stacks. Your non-KYC wallet should not be linked to your identity in any way else it ruins the purpose of a non-KYC stack. \n\nMore on KYC: \nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-will-protect-your-personal-data\n\nLots of resources/information on the process of purchasing Non-KYC Bitcoin here: \nhttps://99bitcoins.com/buy-bitcoin/anonymously-without-id/", "link": "https://coinatmradar.com/"}, {"text": "Bitcoin privacy guide:\nhttps://bitcoiner.guide/privacy/", "link": "https://bitcoiner.guide/privacy/"}, {"text": "Gigi on privacy best practices:\nhttps://dergigi.com/2021/03/14/bitcoin-privacy-best-practices/", "link": "https://dergigi.com/2021/03/14/bitcoin-privacy-best-practices/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/privacy-nonkyc_312_privacy-nonkyc_btc-hats.jpg"]}, {"text": "<b>LIGHTNING PRIVACY</b>\nTransacting on the Lightning Network is very private.
