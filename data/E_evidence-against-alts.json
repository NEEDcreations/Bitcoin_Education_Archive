Ethereum is DINO (decentralized in name only). Here is why. Ethereum had a 70% premine. This means that 70% of the market supply is controlled by a handful of its early adopters who were given the opportunity to purchase thousands of Ether for exchange of 1 bitcoin. Roughly 31,000 bitcoin were exchanged (unconfirmed number). This happened before the network and mining went online, hence, a premine. More on the premine: https://www.coindesk.com/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine\nHere is a thread of arguments over the premine, if you're interested: https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1280140252737343488\n\n30% of Ethereum nodes are essentially controlled by three CEOs. Amazon, Alibaba, and Google control more Ethereum nodes than any other group on the planet. Venture Capitalists flock to Ethereum because they love control. \n\n99.9% of ERC-20 tokens built on the Ethereum network are scams, pump-and-dumps, rug pulls and Ponzi schemes. History of dead coins prove this. See the list that grows every day: https://99bitcoins.com/deadcoins/\n\nAny token built on top of the Ethereum network is not decentralized, despite what you're told. How can something be decentralized when its base layer, Ethereum, isn't decentralized itself? This just isn't possible. This is another reason why Bitcoin is so valuable. Any layer built on top of Bitcoin will be decentralized because its base layer is decentralized. This is VERY important!", "link": "https://www.coindesk.com/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine"}, {"text": "<b>CENSORSHIP</b>\nVitalik and his coder friends have ultimate say and control over the Ethereum code and protocol. They have changed Ethereum's monetary policy multiple times already since its inception in 2015 without permission or even the consideration of the voice of the rest of its users. First ETH was supposed to be a \"world computer,\" and then it became \"Ultra-sound Money,\" next ETH was supposed to be a gaming platform, after that it became home to NFTs and Web3...what's next? And I probably missed some of the narratives...Let's compare that to Bitcoin --Bitcoin's monetary policy hasn't changed since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system as originally intended by Satoshi. End of story."}, {"text": "<b>BITCOIN CAN AND WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING DONE ON ETHEREUM</b>\nSmart contracts, decentralized finance, gaming applications, and more...whatever you see being done on Ethereum will eventually be done on Bitcoin. It takes longer to develop code on Bitcoin, mainly because Bitcoin isn't Turing Complete while Ethereum is Turing Complete (for Bitcoin's purpose, this is actually a net positive for Bitcoin). A Turing Complete system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer (although with no guarantees regarding runtime or memory). So, if somebody says \"my new thing is Turing Complete\" that means in principle (although often not in practice) it could be used to solve any computation problem. That sounds amazing in theory, but practically, due the complexity in getting everything right and being able to understand every part of the execution of the code, the outcome will require a programmer to be skillful and really good....this is what Solidity, Ethereum's coding language is...it's Turing Complete. There is LOTS of room for error when coding on ETH. This is why we frequently see hacks and other problems on the ETH network.\n\nTo see more on smart contracts being built on Bitcoin, check out https://www.stacks.co/\nAs well as accounts https://twitter.com/muneeb and https://twitter.com/Stacks\n\n<b>SUPPLY</b>\nEther's supply has no limit unlike bitcoin's limit of 21,000,000. In fact, no one actually knows the current supply of Ethereum. You can look at this as the exact same problem we currently have with fiat money- endless printing of currency which inevitably leads to a financial crisis with hyperinflation and an unstable economy. This is in direct opposition to those who state that Ether is a better sound money and store of value than Bitcoin", "link": "https://www.stacks.co/"}, {"text": "<b>PROOF OF STAKE</b>\nEthereum is moving from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake....all I have to say is, good luck with that.
