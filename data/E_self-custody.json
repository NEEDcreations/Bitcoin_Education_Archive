First of all, your coins should not be left on an exchange. As the saying goes, \"not your keys, not your coins.\" What this means is that actually owning your Bitcoin means you are fully in control of your private keys that give you access to your digital property (your Bitcoin). By leaving your Bitcoin on an exchange, you are in essence trusting that exchange with your private keys. God forbid something happen to that exchange, they have the right to withhold your Bitcoin indefinitely, or worse, they could lose your coins permanently due to a hack or some related catastrophe.\n\nYour password for your bitcoin is what is known as your private keys. Never tell your private keys to anyone. Never store them on the internet or take a picture of them. If they are off the internet and not stored anywhere they can't be hacked. Instead. just write them down and store it in a safe (preferably fireproof). If you lose or forget your private keys, your coins are likely lost forever. However, I have learned about a service called KeychainX that works to recover forgotten pins. There may be hope if all else fails."}, {"text": "For the same reason above, you shouldn't use an online wallet to store your Bitcoin. These are called \"hot wallets\" (wallets stored on the internet in any way).The easiest thing you can do is purchase a cold storage device like a Trezor or a Keep Key. From there, as you gain experience, you can take additional steps to improve the security of your Bitcoin such as using a multisignature (multisig) wallet address as outlined here: https://armantheparman.com/bitcoin-storage-get-better/\n\nFor a secure and recommended way to back up your wallet seed phrase, see: https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874319558641610802/876973683145596969 \n\nSplitting Bitcoin seed vs Multi Sig Wallet thread: https://twitter.com/parman_the/status/1432387266928910336?s=20\n\nHow to set up an airgapped device (Glacier).
