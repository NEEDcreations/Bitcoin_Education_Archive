Good point"},{"text":"Bump"},{"text":"💲Transaction Fees"},{"text":"<@348227462725107712>"},{"text":"Not quite. The security of the network isn't backed by total hashrate or electricity usage.\n\nIt's backed by total value-cost of the security subsidy.\n\nIt doesn't matter if hashrate cost decreases. It will decrease both for miners and attackers.\n\nWhat matters is the total <b>value-cost</b> of the hashrate being used. So if hashrate gets cheaper, to simply maintain the same level of security would mean an equal increase in total hashrate to equate to the same total value-cost of the total hashrate."}]}
