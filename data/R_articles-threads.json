There have been many periods throughout history where governments were not the custodians of the money supply. Unfortunately, today almost every nation employs a central bank that has a monopoly on what currency is allowed to be used within their domain. \n\nThe original signatories to this document believe that central banks and governments throughout the world have abused their exorbitant privilege of printing money. This document proposes a new way of doing things. \n\nWe are not calling for an end to the U.S. dollar or any other fiat currency — we are asking to bring an end to monopoly money in every country. Give citizens a choice. \n\nLet market forces and participants decide if they want this new form of “magic internet money” that is based on rules, not rulers. Bitcoin benefits the entire planet. Those who sign believe bitcoin is a peaceful revolution that favors the billions, not billionaires.
