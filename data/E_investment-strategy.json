HODL</b>\n\nWhat I've learned is that the BEST way to approach investing in Bitcoin (and most other assets) is to first lump sum as much money as you possibly can as soon as you possibly can. From there, dollar cost average (DCA) either daily or weekly (daily has shown to provide better returns than weekly). The easiest way to daily DCA is through my SWAN referral link here: https://www.swanbitcoin.com/philfaz. \nThen simply HODL (hold your investment/don't sell it) for at least 4 years (through one complete Bitcoin cycle). \nThe HODL Commandments:\nhttps://bholr.com\n\nIf you follow this strategy, history (as well as the math/code) complete with a limited supply and high demand proves that you will make a nice return on your investment. This is the strategy I use. Personally, I don't plan on selling ANY of my Bitcoin for at least 10 years. I treat my stack as a long term savings account. No one who has invested money in Bitcoin and held for at least 3 years has lost any money. In fact, the average annual return of a bitcoin investment is 100-200%. Bitcoin will one day absorb all the world's wealth. As they say, \u221e/21MM, meaning that all existing and future value divided by the 21 million BTC supply equals bitcoin's true value- a number so immense that denominating in USD doesn't even make sense. This of course, is not financial advice. All investments come with risk.\n\nLump sum > DCA research: https://twitter.com/w_s_bitcoin/status/1489707655488802821?s=20&t=yaYraSRSkL-PZ99TJOm08w\nResearch that supports this strategy: https://ofdollarsanddata.com/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum/\nMore research: https://eng.ambcrypto.com/should-you-buy-bitcoin-daily-or-weekly/\nEven more research: https://shitcoin.ninja/post/2019/10/comparing-bitcoin-investment-strategies/\nMore:\nhttps://bitcoinist.com/latest-research-compares-bitcoin-btc-investment-strategies/", "link": "https://www.swanbitcoin.com/philfaz."}, {"text": "<b>DIVERSIFICATION</b>\nIf you've invested in anything before like maybe the stock market, you might have heard from someone that it is a good idea to \"diversify your portfolio.\" While diversifying does decrease your risk of losing everything, I do not believe this is a good practice to follow in the cryptocurrency market. Again, this is not financial advice, but let me ask you: If you made a bet at a horse race, would you put small  bets on most of the horses...or a reasonable sized bet on the horse you think has the best chance to win? With this idea in mind, you should be investing everything into the cryptocurrency that will win. I do believe that to be Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.\n\n<b>YIELD & LEVERAGE</b>\nThe longer you're in this space, the longer you'll be tempted to loan out your Bitcoin with the temptation to earn a fabulous yield. The yields advertised by services like BlockFi, Celcius, Voyager, Nexo, etc. are much higher than what you'd receive from a traditional bank savings account. This seems too good to be true, right? In a way, it is. You see, when you sign up for these services, you are loaning your Bitcoin to them so that they can turn a profit by using it on their end. As the saying goes, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. If something were to happen to the platform you're using, they have the right to withhold you from withdrawing your Bitcoin indefinitely. This will be laid out to you word-for-word in their terms of service. This is very dangerous, and I do not recommend messing with it at all. It is not worth risking your Bitcoin stack that is already appreciating 100-200% per year for an additional 5%."}, {"text": "You can also borrow against your Bitcoin (tax free) as shown here (Michael Saylor strategy). Personally, I probably will never do this because it means you have to give up full control of your stack. But here is a resource if you are interested: https://youtu.be/OvAEQhbuvMI.\n\nAnother option you have is to take a loan in fiat to buy bitcoin. In my eyes, if you can afford the minimum payments of the loan, then I see no problem in doing this. Again, this is NOT financial advice. But say you can get a loan for 12% interest, if you believe that Bitcoin can overperform that 12% over an extended amount of time, then why not take the loan?
