Do NFTs on [Bitcoin specifically] exist right now? Or are some just funded/bought with BTC? What exactly is https://raretoshi.com/ ? Is raretoshi affiliated with Ethereum or Bitcoin? Personally, I do think NFTs as rare digital collectibles is an interesting idea. I do think there is value there. I don't like them on Ethereum, and I agree with some of your points that right now, it seems like they are a scheme heading towards a rug pull. I kind of view the ETH NFT space as a test net for Bitcoin NFTs (kind of like what Bitcoin does for development anyway, testing things on other chains).

Sure they may simmer down and become a little less trendy but I think they have a future in the digital space. There is a lot of potential for NFTs for many reasons. Especially, virtual reality becomes perfected and we have an “oasis” (ready player one reference) I recommend the book and movie to everyone in here. So, if we have this awesome virtual reality world NFTs basically will be hot items you’ll be able to use in the virtual world. I’m excited to see what the future holds for NFTs.
