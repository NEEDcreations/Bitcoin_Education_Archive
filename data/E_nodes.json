There are currently about 14,000 Bitcoin nodes worldwide which speaks to the real decentralization and security of the Bitcoin network. There is no single point of failure to shut down Bitcoin. Nuclear war could (God forbid) wipe out 3/4 of the planet, but as long as one Bitcoin node is still functional, Bitcoin will continue to run uninterrupted. You could even find the first computer that ever downloaded the Bitcoin code (if it still exists) and destroy it; that wont matter. Bitcoin can not be stopped or deleted.\n\n<b>WHAT NODES DO</b>\nNodes validate and process transactions on the Bitcoin network. When a bitcoin transactions happens, every node gets a veto to decide if this transaction was valid. They need to come to a full consensus on this vote- if any node decides a transaction is invalid, then the transaction doesn't actually occur. The role of a node is to communicate with the other nodes in the network directly, verifying that their history of transactions is aligned with the next node. As they verify new transactions, they check to see that the bitcoin being transacted has not been double-spent and that no bitcoin is being created out of thin air. If a node does see malicious transaction attempts, it along with the other nodes in the network will reject the transactions. Users (nodes), not miners or developers, decide which blocks are valid and which software to run."}, {"text": "Software: \nhttps://btcdir.org/links/nodessoftware/", "link": "https://btcdir.org/links/nodessoftware/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_267_nodes_TwitterCard-2.jpg"]}, {"text": "Hardware:\nhttps://btcdir.org/links/nodeshardware/", "link": "https://btcdir.org/links/nodeshardware/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_267_nodes_TwitterCard-2.jpg"]}, {"text": "Stats and maps:\nhttps://btcdir.org/links/nodesother/", "link": "https://btcdir.org/links/nodesother/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_267_nodes_TwitterCard-2.jpg"]}, {"text": "Node community (Plebnet):\nhttps://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Main_Page", "link": "https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Main_Page"}, {"text": "https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874330263096815757/908884345912197190", "link": "https://discord.com/channels/874318808423219280/874330263096815757/908884345912197190"}, {"text": "Build a Self-Custodial Lightning Node with RaspiBlitz\nhttps://www.econoalchemist.com/post/build-a-self-custodial-lightning-node-with-raspiblitz", "link": "https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/build-a-self-custodial-lightning-node-with-raspiblitz"}, {"text": "Live map of Bitcoin nodes:\nhttps://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/", "link": "https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_265_nodes_bitnodes-logo.png"]}, {"text": "Visualization of one node's work \"this is just my node's view of the network, so the contents of the mempool and transaction arrival times will vary from other nodes.\"\nvia https://twitter.com/mononautical\nhttps://bits.monospace.live/?s=09", "link": "https://twitter.com/mononautical"}, {"text": "https://twitter.com/FullyNoded/status/1468998503175237635?t=BdkNcmlG1sJZCIXHLUf8WQ&s=19", "link": "https://twitter.com/FullyNoded/status/1468998503175237635?t=BdkNcmlG1sJZCIXHLUf8WQ&s=19"}, {"text": "https://twitter.com/CarlBMenger/status/1472506364241002496?t=1p5MJauBdDjqb0BxLB9xiQ&s=19", "link": "https://twitter.com/CarlBMenger/status/1472506364241002496?t=1p5MJauBdDjqb0BxLB9xiQ&s=19"}, {"text": "Run a node on your phone with ABcore?", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_261_Screenshot_20220101-222600.png"]}, {"text": "Six reasons to run a node:\nhttps://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/", "link": "https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_260_nodes_cropped-crop.png"]}, {"text": "Real time node stats:\nhttps://statoshi.info/", "link": "https://statoshi.info/"}, {"text": "Helpful tips for running a lightning node here\nhttps://yalls.org/", "link": "https://yalls.org/"}, {"text": "Raspiblitz start here:\nhttps://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz", "link": "https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz"}, {"text": "Umbrel tutorial \nhttps://youtu.be/fppmhqjqh2E", "link": "https://youtu.be/fppmhqjqh2E", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_259_nodes_maxresdefault.jpg"]}, {"text": "Tor-Only Bitcoin & Lightning Guide"}, {"text": "https://blog.lopp.net/tor-only-bitcoin-lightning-guide/", "link": "https://blog.lopp.net/tor-only-bitcoin-lightning-guide/", "imgs": ["images/experienced/nodes_258_nodes_network.png"]}, {"text": "Strategy on running a profitable lightning node https://twitter.com/ErinEMalone/status/1416901431181807617?t=1YDRL79TeJMumz4jcGe5IA&s=19", "link": "https://twitter.com/ErinEMalone/status/1416901431181807617?t=1YDRL79TeJMumz4jcGe5IA&s=19"}, {"text": "You can use sparrow wallet to point to your own node to make sure your transactions are secure"}, {"text": "The Bitcoin blockchain from space.
