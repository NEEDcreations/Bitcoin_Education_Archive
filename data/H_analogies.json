Bitcoin is already a store of value and a medium of exchange in some countries (like El Salvador). Next stop is unit of account.

A small group of people keep making more of it out nothing. \n\nDo you play poker?"},{"text":"Me either! Lol. But I have. Poker is a game. And the reason people can get together and play poker is because there is a set of rules that they all agree on. \n\nIf one of the players could change the rules at any given point just because they felt like doing so. The game would be impossible to play. \n\nIt is the unchanging rules that allow for people to work together. Fiat printing is essentially changing the rules over and over again. It breaks down the fabric of society because people don’t what the rules of the game are. \n\nLong term bitcoin wins out because it’s rules don’t change which allows for cooperation between people. If bitcoin doesn’t win the world is pretty bleak. My opinion"},{"text":"the dollar does not change either though"},{"text":"rules are always the same with that"},{"text":"As long as people think in terms of Fiat (meaning they do the mental math in their head to redenominate Sats back into Fiat) then Bitcoin/Sats will never be used to value a home or other assets. Just my two sats."},{"text":"Very time the government prints money out of now where the dollar changes. We just don’t see it because our current system is measured by that changing dollar"},{"text":"Fair"},{"text":"I think eventually people “think in sats”. Probably many many many years though"},{"text":"yeah. It may take a generation or two.

But to replace the Fiat system it obviously does. And to transition and get on zero it also only makes sense."},{"text":"Fair enough. Becoming a unit of account would be a huge step, but I think even if it doesn’t, then that’s ok. Because that’ll probably mean a successful “fiat” that was backed by bitcoin was established instead and that may not be a bad thing."},{"text":"Bitcoin is a living organism.

She seals the slip inside an opaque blank envelope and hands that, plus $100 in cash, to a teller, who signs the exterior of the envelope, transferring the bank’s signature onto the carbon slip inside. The bank does not know which exact slip was inside, but the user can leave the bank, remove the slip, and — voila — she now has an official promise to pay. She can swap this slip for cash or goods with others, or spend it at a participating merchant. When the time comes to redeem the slip for dollars, anyone can turn in the slip to a teller — who can verify the signature — but the bank does not know who made the initial deposit, nor does it know who made what transactions between deposit and redemption, giving users full privacy."},{"text":"Bitcoin maxis are bitcoin's immune system\nhttps://twitter.com/Oialt2/status/1555142273826193409?s=20&t=QnVcsMj4Jz_tIUu-EeJrFA","link":"https://twitter.com/Oialt2/status/1555142273826193409?s=20&t=QnVcsMj4Jz_tIUu-EeJrFA"},{"text":"Bitcoin is The Mycelium of Money\nThread:\nhttps://twitter.com/level39/status/1556148568087576584?s=20&t=8Ef_gvkoFHZsyz8zavnP0g\nFull article:\nhttps://brandonquittem.com/bitcoin-is-the-mycelium-of-money/","link":"https://twitter.com/level39/status/1556148568087576584?s=20&t=8Ef_gvkoFHZsyz8zavnP0g"},{"text":"PoW is like finding a 4-leaf clover.
