The concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1993 as a way to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from a service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. The term \"proof of work\" was first coined and formalized in a 1999 paper by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels.\nProof of work (PoW) describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service attacks. The concept was subsequently adapted to securing digital money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of \"reusable proof of work\" using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.\nFollowing its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin became the first widely adopted application of Finney's PoW idea \nMore of PoW: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work"}, {"text": "Not so fun, but a man from the UK threw away a hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoin on it.
