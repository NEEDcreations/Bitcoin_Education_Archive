It mostly benefited the bigger private entities and was designed to attract foreign investment, which it did. However, the poor class was hurt very badly by the regulations and imposing of USD. \nAt the time this was implemented the exchange rate Colon/USD was around 8.50 Colones/USD. To facilitate/speed up the movement of a whole country to USD there was a lot of rounding up done in setting the new USD prices. So when people went to buy something with prices expressed in USD the rate would be something more like 9.00 \u2013 10.00 Colones/USD.
