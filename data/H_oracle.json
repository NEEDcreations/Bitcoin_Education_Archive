Bitcoin doesn't know who won the Super Bowl, so if you wanted to use a DLT to make a bet on the Super Bowl on Bitcoin, an oracle (a person in the real world) would need to tell Bitcoin the result of the Super Bowl to pay out the bet correctly. This information doesn't get posted to the blockchain, but the information influences the blockchain. There is trust involved in this oracle, obviously. Devs try to \"limit\" the knowledge of the oracles to minimize trust."}, {"text": "🔮Oracle"}]}
