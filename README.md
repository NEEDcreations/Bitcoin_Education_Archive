Welcome to the Bitcoin Education Archive, which is live under https://bitcoineducation.quest

The entire site was built by my Openclaw agent named Ruffus using Claude Opus 4.6

The education featured in the website came from years of currating information on my Bitcoin Education Discord server. Now, it's all open source!

What we need right now are testers. Just play around with the site, find bugs, and report them. Request features if you think something would be a cool addition too!

Thank you so much! - Phil @NEEDcreations
