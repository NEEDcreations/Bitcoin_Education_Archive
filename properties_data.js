One is that there is no person, group, or central authority in charge of Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin CEO or Bitcoin board of directors or head of marketing. No one can decide to mint more than the max supply of Bitcoin. Everyone has to follow the rules set forth by math and the code. The second reason Bitcoin is decentralized is because it is composed of a network of users who run Bitcoin nodes all over the world. See <#874331220618670120> for more information about how Bitcoin is decentralized in that regard. Thirdly, Bitcoin <#874331239081975929> is decentralized. While most mining occurs in the United States and Kazakhstan, there is hashing power coming from most countries in the world.\n\nThere is an additional take on decentralization. Bitcoin being decentralized means that it has removed intermediaries. Transactions can be made peer-to-peer without having to trust a third party. Additionally, Bitcoin doesn't have any gatekeepers who can control what you do with your money and to who and why you send money somewhere.\n\n<b>TRUSTLESS</b>\nThe major concept inherent in a decentralized network like Bitcoin is that it is a functional system operating on a *trustless* manor. Nobody transacting with Bitcoin has to trust a third party like a bank to ensure that their transaction is valid; this is the innovation that Bitcoin has unleashed.

Bitcoin is not a company, it is a protocol and network with a set of rules (math and code) without rulers. Everyone participating on the Bitcoin network must follow the rules. No central authority or government body or banker is needed to process transactions. With all these underpinnings in mind, Bitcoin is also resistant to *corruption*.

Additionally, 2-3 million coins are actually either lost due to lost or forgotten passwords or seemingly locked away forever (approximately 1 million of those coins are in the creator Satoshi's wallet and haven't moved from it since 2012). Because of the supply limit, Bitcoin is scarce and therefore is also known as a trophy asset (something like real estate or a rare collectible). \n\nWhat makes something scarce is its unforgeable costliness meaning it’s sufficiently hard to produce and hard to fake the production cost of. In other words, easy to verify the validity of. Bitcoin is both of these things do to Proof-of-Work.\n\n* *Technically, the maximum supply of Bitcoin is actually 20,999,999.9769 because the supply issuance is asymptotic (it's cut in half ~every 4 years).

Bitcoin is a honeypot of over $800 billion and has been under attack every hour of every day since gaining significant value around 2013. Every day that passes, Bitcoin's security gets stronger. This is because more and more computers join the network as both nodes and miners. \n\n<b>BITCOIN CAN'T BE HACKED</b>\nI will look for the source that described how hard it would be to actually try to hack the Bitcoin network (I think it was from an Andreas lecture...). Bitcoin is practically unforgeable. In order to attack/hack it, you would have to alter the Bitcoin Blockchain. It is very difficult to write new history to the Blockchain because it is so costly to forge it while there are always low costs to validate it. Andreas stated something along the lines of in order to rewrite (and hack) the Bitcoin blockchain, the hackers would have to gain 51% of the mining power (\"51% attack\") for roughly 2 or so weeks and risk billions upon billions of dollars doing so trying to forge the Blockchain. It is a great risk for the hackers because if the number of miners \"hacking\" drops below 51% at any point during the hack, the hack fails and every bad miner just wasted tons of resources for nothing...let alone they didn't earn any real Bitcoin from the mining they would have been doing if they weren't trying to hack fake Bitcoin. To put this into perspective on how hard it would be to get 51% of the mining network on your side: if Google decided to program all their servers and supercomputers to mine Bitcoin, they would only make up less than 1% of the total network\n\nAgain, I need to find this lecture because he explains it much better than that."}, {"text": "The private keys for your Bitcoin wallet (your seed phrase) is also quite impossible to hack by brute force.

Bitcoin is interchangeable with other bitcoin. Bitcoin is also immutable. What this means is it is impossible for any entity to manipulate, replace, falsify or reverse data stored on the network. Bitcoin solved the \"double spend\" problem. No one can falsify or replicate any transaction.\n\nAdam Back on fungibility https://youtu.be/AvS3tp0qqgA", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY."}, {"text": "<b>IMMUTABILITY/INCORRUPTIBILITY</b>\nBitcoin is immutable in that its monetary policy is set in stone and it can not be changed. This was made possible for three main reasons: 1) Bitcoin didn't have a premine. 2) There is no official foundation behind Bitcoin. 3) The founder (Satoshi) stepped down. \n\nImmutability is dependent on having a currency that is native to it, like Bitcoin. There is this idea that Bitcoin is really good at two things- It is good at currency issuance and currency settlement. It is a closed loop system that does not know anything else about the outside world; it doesn't need to know anything else. What Bitcoin does very well is it knows with 100% certainty what is and what isn't Bitcoin. In doing that, and in order to incentivize the security mechanism to ensure that an invalid transaction will not be validated, the Blockchain needs to pay for Bitcoin's security. It needs to pay for it in a way that can be a closed loop system that only knows how to validate Bitcoin. Bitcoin, the currency, wouldn't be valuable without its Blockchain, but its Blockchain wouldn't be viable, relevant, and valid without its property of immutability. The Blockchain needs its own native currency (Bitcoin) to pay for the security (through transaction verifications) it receives from miners, a process that happens every new block every 10 minutes (mining reward) as well as with transaction fees.\n\nMore of immutability by Andreas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1SHF3YPrjM\n\n<b>IMMALEABLE</b>\nBitcoin uses energy through proof-of-work to build an uneditable (immalleable) record of all the Bitcoins in existence and who owns them.

It was created after the system of barter became inefficient (because how many chickens does one barrel of rice cost?). There are the key features that define money and the properties of Bitcoin that fit the mold: durability (Bitcoin can't be destroyed unless you forget your password/keys), portability (Bitcoin is digital, it has no weight and can be transported anywhere in the world very quickly at little cost), divisibility (see below), fungibility/uniformity (1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin no matter where you are and when you transact with it), limited supply (21 million coin limit) and general acceptability/recognizability as a payment method. Bitcoin inherently has all of these features except general acceptability as a payment method. However, this will come when Bitcoin is more widely adopted over time.\n\nIn order to become actual money used by everyone, Bitcoin needs to experience and go through three stages: store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account.

Many people, including myself, view their Bitcoin stacks as a savings account. What makes something a store of value is that it is able to hold its value over time. The main reason that Bitcoin is a great store of value is that Bitcoin has a supply limit. The main reason that the price keeps rising so quickly is because Bitcoin's issuance is slowing deflating (half as many new coins are minted about every 4 years). This is a very basic concept of supply and demand on steroids. This is also why Bitcoin can be described as \"hard money.\" Bitcoin's money supply can't be inflated."}, {"text": "As bitcoin gets readily adopted over time and demand goes up while its liquid supply decreases as issuance goes down and more and more people decide to hold their bitcoin long term, the price will keep going up until (seemingly) all of the world's wealth is in bitcoin.\n\n<b>MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE (PAYING)</b>\nBitcoin is working its way as being a medium of exchange. Some stores and services accept Bitcoin as payment. Some employers pay their employees in Bitcoin. Some NFL players receive part of their salary in bitcoin.

Self sovereignty. Take control of your savings. Take control of your future.\n2. Censorship resistance. No government, bank or person stands between you and your money.\n3. Remittance payments with little to no fees\n4. Code is law. Everyone follows the same rules, enforced by math and code\n5. Immutability. It is impossible for any entity to manipulate, replace, falsify or reverse data stored on the network. Bitcoin's blockchain is permanent history.\n6. Decrease the wealth gap/level the playing field\n7. Reduction in violence/potential for war by making the Petro dollar insignificant \n8. Bitcoin removes the human element of tampering with money and it's supply which inevitably leads to the corruption & debasement of money that has plagued civilization for 10,000 years of existing monetary policy. This one is BIG! \n9. Bitcoin provides financial services for the billions of un-banked people across the world. \n10. A world with Bitcoin is a happier world. When the value of money appreciates, people are likely to be far more discerning with their consumption and to and to save far more of their income for the future. Such a world would cause people to develop a lower time preference, as their monetary decisions will orient their actions towards the future, teaching them to value the future more and more."}, {"text": "11. Bitcoin counters the Cantillon Effect, where those closest to the money spigot get the most benefits (and the rich get richer). \n12. More than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it's produced during the hours of the day when there isn't a demand to consume it. Bitcoin miners use this wasted energy to create Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin miners are moving to Wyoming, Texas, and Alberta where oil rigs flare off huge quantities of waste methane. They capture this methane with portable mining equipment. Not only are they taking the natural gas and using it as electricity, they are capturing the carbon and put it underground (not venting it and creating acid rain and CO2). This helps the environment and turns a profit at the same time! \n13. Bitcoin is a movement that all political parties can get behind and support. Bitcoin is probably the most bipartisan idea this world has ever seen. Bitcoin is free speech. Bitcoin is freedom.\n14. Bitcoin provides an economic system/framework that is in line with the current deflationary environment of tech. We cannot move towards an energetically “sustainable” future in an economic system that incentivizes consumption and spending, while the improving technology is naturally deflationary and more efficient. This is all laid out in the book The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth and is one of the most powerful macro arguments in favor of Bitcoin. We haven't upgraded our money in over 100 years. Bitcoin is the upgrade.\n15. Bitcoin incentivizes saving again, plain and simple. You can save your money without losing purchasing power in the future. This is completely distinct from investing, which is required in our inflationary system to try to maintain purchasing power. Due to rising inflation, people can't even save money these days, which is crazy! Bitcoin gives us an option to save."}, {"text": "16. Bitcoin enables very fast, low fee, secure transactions of any amount to anyone in the world at any time.\n17. Bitcoin, unlike legacy banking services, is open before 9AM and doesn't close after 5PM or on weekends or holidays. \n18. You can transact with anyone without having to trust them or rely on a third party to enforce the transaction.\n19. There are ways to hold and transact with Bitcoin that aren't directly tied to your identity (privacy factor).\n20. Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized coin. There is no CEO, board of directors or marketing team behind Bitcoin.\n21. Bitcoin can be transacted with on the lightning network that enables instant, nearly free global transactions at any time."}, {"text": "Another take on 21 reasons why bitcoin will save the world:\nhttps://darthcoin.substack.com/p/21-reasons-why-bitcoin-will-save", "link": "https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/21-reasons-why-bitcoin-will-save"}, {"text": "Circumvent the Russian Putin regime https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1484186042899079169?t=KhUaHP49QvJ293TigXxRkg&s=19", "link": "https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1484186042899079169?t=KhUaHP49QvJ293TigXxRkg&s=19", "imgs": ["images/properties/use-cases_use-cases_FJjbvnFUYAEf4oa.png", "images/properties/use-cases_use-cases_FJjh3M6VcAc2DnD.png"]}, {"text": "Thread of use cases \nhttps://twitter.com/skwp/status/1335627973915971592?t=oUxbM8t6a24QK-zE3MqRdw&s=19", "link": "https://twitter.com/skwp/status/1335627973915971592?t=oUxbM8t6a24QK-zE3MqRdw&s=19"}, {"text": "One underrated feature of Bitcoin is that it can be spent in any amount imaginable.\n\nHigh value payments are great for wealthy elites, but the low value payments will change the world.\n\nSo many new use cases that simply aren't possible with cash, credit cards, and bank wires.", "imgs": ["images/properties/use-cases_20220214_064714.jpg"]}, {"text": "As we're seeing today with the Ukraine, Russia conflict, Bitcoin is a safe haven.
